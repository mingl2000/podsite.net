Build better cloud applications by understanding proven architectural patterns. We cover microservices, serverless, containers, and more.

Discussion points:
- Monolithic vs microservices trade-offs
- Kubernetes and container orchestration
- Event-driven architectures
- Database patterns in the cloud
- Cost optimization strategies

Great for architects and senior engineers.
